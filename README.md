# Brounte-Sandretto

This project documents the process and details of connecting a Brounte Robot to a Sandretto Series 8 Injection Moulding Machine. The primary interface standard used for this connection is Euromap 12.

## Project Goal

The main objective is to successfully establish communication and safe, coordinated operation between the Brounte Robot and the Sandretto IMM, enabling automated part handling.

## Key Information & Documentation

-   **Euromap 12 Interface:** Detailed information regarding the Euromap 12 signal definitions, pinouts, and specific wiring considerations for this robot/IMM combination can be found in [Issue #1: Euromap 12 Interface Details and Wiring Guide](https://github.com/glennss/Brounte-Sandretto/issues/1). This includes:
    -   Standard Euromap 12 signal tables.
    -   Notes from the Sandretto IMM's specific wiring diagram.
    -   A consolidated wiring map.
    -   Important safety and wiring guidelines.

## Current Status

-   The project is currently in the documentation and planning phase for the physical wiring and interface setup.
-   The necessary signal mappings and reference documents are being gathered and organized (see Issue #1).

## Next Steps

1.  Upload relevant physical wiring diagrams and Euromap 12 documentation (image files) to this repository.
2.  Verify robot controller output types (dry contact, PNP, NPN).
3.  Proceed with physical wiring based on the documented plan, adhering to all safety precautions.
4.  Test and commission the interface.
